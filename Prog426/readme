:::::HOW TO COMPILE AND RUN CODE ON THE COOJA SIMULATOR::::


In the Prog426 file, open terminal and enter the command
"make telosb"

This will compile the code and create a "build" file. 

Open the "build" file and then open the "telosb" file. In the "telosb" file there is a "main.exe". This executable will be used to run the program in the cooja simulator. 


Now we can start the cooja simulator.
First open the "cooja" file and in terminal type in the command "sudo ant run"

Once Cooja is open, go to file -> new simulation and enter a simulation name and click "create"

Once a new simulation is created. Go to 
		Motes -> add motes -> create new mote type -> sky mote..

When the "Create Mote Type: compile contiki for sky" window is open, click "browse" and search for the executable "main.exe" that we created. Then click "create"

a "Add motes (sky mote type #sky1)" window will open. Since we want to 2 motes, change "Number of new motes" to 2. And then click "add motes"

In the network window you will see two motes. Make sure the two motes are close enough to each other otherwise it will not work.

In the simulation control window change the "speed limit" to 100%

We can now start the simulation by clicking "start"
